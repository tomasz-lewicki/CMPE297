# Motion planing hierarchy:
__Planning__ - Process of finding colission free path between A and B.
Path could be represented as an array of state vectors in time (?)

__Workspace__ - the represenation of the __world__. Often describes reachability. Example _(x,y, [if_occupied])

__Configuration space__ - the space of all possible configurations of the robot. Configuration vector describes the state of the robot (actuator positions, orientation). E.g. _(x,y, theta)_ for a two wheeled differential robot.


Module (input)

- Route planning (takes: user destination, road network data) -> Sequence of waypoints 
- Behavioral layer (takes: sequence of waypoints, obstacle perception) -> Manuvers
- Motion planing (takes: estimated pose, intended manuvers) -> reference path
- Local motion control (takes: reference path) -> output control vector (steering, throttle, brake)

# General steps of motion planning:
## 1. Define _C_ __(configuration space)__
## 2. Discretize _C_

Typical discretizations:
- cell decomposition
- potential field
- roadmap

After discretization the problem can be solved by graph algorithms

Discretization can cause problems - you generally find only an optimal path at a given discretization level

__Grid lattice__  - a set of motion primitives and constructing them into a tree

## 3. Search _C_ 

__completeness__ - an algorithm finds an optimal solution if one exists.
__resolution complete__ - finds an optimal solution if it exists at given resolution level

### Graph search methods:
- Breadth-first search (BFS)
    + does not use the existing information, non-informative search
- Depth-first search (DFS)
    + does not use the existing information, non-informative search
- Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm
    + search with weighted edges
- A* Algorithm
    + heuristic, informative search
    + global optimization, global routing

### A* search

- Generally, start from the start, grow tree until you find a solution (path to goal)
- Expanding a node refers to adding children to the tree, pushing them onto the open set
- Try to expand as few tree nodes as possible

__Heuristic__ is any optimistic estimate of how close a state is to a goal. Examples: Manhattan distance, Euclidean distance


#### A* keeps track of two sets of nodes:
- open (frontier nodes that are sorted by priority)
- closed (nodes that have already been expanded)

#### Priority 
Priority is established based on the following function
f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
_g - cost to arrive_
_h - heuristic (optimistic estimate to the goal)_ 

Djikstra is a special case of A* where h === 0


# Frenet frame

Describe kinematics of a point moving along a continuous differentiable curve in R3 (3-dimensional space).

We describe it with three spatial vectors:
- Tangential
- Normal 
- Binormal


# Optimal trajectory generation in frenet frame

Searching through the restrited space is difficult and could be solved numerically

That's why they search within optimal solutions to the unrestricted problem and then apply constraints

- Temporal consistency is an advantage
- Divides the navigation task into:
    + real-time trajectory generation
    + tracking & feedback control
- Does not focus on cost fun. minimalization
- Minimizes jerk but also time


# Lattice planner workflow

## 1. identify feasible trajectories

We're representing trajectory as a function of state vector in time:
```
p(0) = a_1 + a_2 * t + a_3 * t^2 +  a_4 * t^3 + a_5 * t^4 + a_6 * t^6
```
For example for lateral trajectory:
d(t) = a_1 + a_2 * t + ...
d'(t) = a_2 + 2 a_3 * t + ...

## 2. assign cost function to each

An example of a cost function for lateral movement could be:
```
C = kj * J(d(t)) + kt * T + kd * d^2
```
The 3 parts of this sum are responsible for:
- jerk
- time
- distance from the center

For longitudal movement:
```
C =  kj * J(d(t)) + kt * T + kv * [v-v_ideal]^2
```
Instead of distance from the center we have error from ideal speed
