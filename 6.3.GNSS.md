# GNSS - Global Navigation Satelite  System

__datum__ - a coordinate system, and a set of reference points, used to locate objects on the Earth. An approximate definition of sea level is the datum WGS 84.

## Carrier Wave

Two frequencies of carrier waves:
- L1 = 154 • 10.23 = 1575.42 Mhz
- L2 = 120 • 10.23 = 1227.60 Mhz

## GPS codes
 
### C/A (Coarse Acquisition) Code

- PRN with chipping rate 1.023 Mhz 
- contains 1023 bits of information
- repeated every milisecond
- one bit is 293 m in length
- the whole sequence is 293km in length and that's the ambiguity of this signal
- PRN sequence has a very strong corelation with itself but very low corelation with other sequences

### P(Y)

- Chipping rate is 10.23 Mhz (bitrate of 10.23Mbps)
- contains around 10^14 bits of information
- is about 29.3m in length


## Each satellite sends (Parkinson and Spilker, 1996):

- a full and precise description of its own orbit and clock data (within the ephemeris information) and an approximate guide to the orbits of other satellites (almanac information).

- parameters representing the delay caused by signal propagation through the ionosphere (called the ionospheric propagation delay parameters).

## Dillusion of precision
It's a result of different precisions in different satelite allignment.
```
HDOP = sqrt(STDEVx^2 + STDEVy^2)
PDOP = sqrt(STDEVx^2 + STDEVy^2 + STDEVz^2)
```

## RTK GPS

Uses carrier wave measurements on top of C/A and P codes
