# Motion pred. models

1. Physics-based: _car will probably go straight through T intersection_ (into the wall)
2. Manuver-based: _car will probably stop before intersection_ (and hit the other car immediately after)
3. Interaction-based _car will yield to everyone at the intersection and then go_


## 1. Physics-based

- Dynamic (based on Lagrange's equations, forces and stuff)
- Kinematic (describe vehicle's motion based on pos, velocity, acceleration)

Uncertainties can be modeled by gaussian distribution.
Trajectories can 

### Limitations:
- only work for short term predictions (<1s)
- unable to predict manuvers (sb. decides to speed up to make it thru the intersection)
- unable to predict changes by external factors (car slows down bc of the vehicle in the front)

### Tools:
- Kalman Filters
- Monte Carlo sampling

## 2. Manuver-based

Motion is represented as a series of manuvers __independent__ from other vehicles

### Tools:
- clustering
- planning as prediction
- hidden markov models
- Goal-oriented models
- Reinforcement Learning


## 3. Interaction-aware models
- trajectory prototypes
- dynamic bayesian networks
