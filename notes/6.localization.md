# LIDAR localization

# Resursive Bayesian Estimation

## Assumptions:
- changes to the environment take place in equidistant timesteps
- sensor measurements arrive at every of those timesteps

## Definitions:

__state__, or _state vector_ - set of variables that characterize the system.

__state space__ - set of all possible values that state vector can take.

For example, a robot on a Cartaesian plane can have state as follows:

```
x = (X, Y, X', Y')
```
or
```
x = (X, Y, X', Y', X'', Y'')
```
Where X' and Y' are velocities along axes. State x is usually hidden and not observable.

__observability__ - one can determine the behavior of the entire system from the system's outputs

__filtering__ - the process of determining the belief from observations is called filtering or state estimation

__belief__ - probablity distribution over all possible states (state space) conditioned by observations so far.

## Recursive estimation

Current belief is estimated as follows:
```
bel(x_t+1) = f(bel(x_t), e_t)
```

Markov assumption:
