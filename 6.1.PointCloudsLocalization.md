# Registration

__point cloud registration__ - finding a transformation to match 2 PC

Registration is aligning a point cloud to a template in a way that minimizes SSE (sum of squared erros)

# Histogram filter( why did we even mention this?) #TODO

Two major algorithms:
- ICP (Iterative Closest Points)
- NDT (Normal Distribution Transform)


# 1. ICP 

## KD-Tree representation of pointcloud

Algorithm:
- pick random dimension
- find median
- split data
- repeat


# 2. NDT algorithm

The goal is to best match point cloud to another pc (template). It means computing a rigid transofrm parameter ```p``` between one point cloud and the other.

## Steps:

1. Calculate the probablity density function over the entire (2D) space. Assign every pixel with a value of likelihood of finding a point there.

- calculate the representation of points in the voxel
- calculate the covariance 
- voila! you have a continous probability distribution

2. Estimate the transform parameter using Newton's algorithm (clasical minimization alg.)

- build NDT of the first scan
- initialize the parameters (e.g. by zero)
- foreach point in scan map it onto the template and create a normal distribution
- evaluate using score
- update the score
- repeat foreach until the convergence criterion is met


## Voxel Filter

Voxel filter reduces a point cloud to e.g. 10% of its original size.

1. Divides the space into 3D grid
2. Calculates the final point as representation of the cell

There are two approaches on how to represent a cell:
- as centroid (the spatial average over each point) __O(n)__
- faster O(1) centroid approximations
- take the center of the cell  __O(1)__ complexity. Cells are empty or occupied then.
