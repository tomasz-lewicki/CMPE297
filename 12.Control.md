# Control

Lingo:
- State = Representation of what the system is currently doing
- Dynamics = Description of how the state changes
- Reference = What we want the system to do
- Output = Measurement of (some aspects of the) system
- Input = Control signal
- Feedback = Mapping from outputs to inputs

Time-domain specifications:
- overshoot
- rise time
- peak time
- setting time

Dynamic vs static:
In static: fixed input -> fixed output
In dynamic: fixed input -/-> fixed output
